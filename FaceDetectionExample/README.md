# Sample project for FaceDetection + CoreImage

This sample is based on [this][1] tutorial which shows the usage of `CIDetector` class, pretty straight forward :)

The aim of this sample is to show the right way to convert coordinates (CoreImage → UIKit) which is not a big deal but the former example does it incorrectly and it seems to have gained some popularity already.

This my (another) one cent to the dev community … blah blah blah.

Hope it helps.
